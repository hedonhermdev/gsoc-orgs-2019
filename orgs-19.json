Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.29 in January 2019). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the About/Statistics page), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (Google Groups forum) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 220 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide.

However, in the grand scheme of things, \u201cartisanal\u201d visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world\u2019s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data. The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design. This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams. On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis. With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. Tools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.", "technologies": ["typescript", "d3", "vega", "vega-lite", "react"]}, {"name": "The Wine Project", "website": "https://www.winehq.org/", "description": "Wine (originally an acronym for \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, Android, Solaris & BSD.
